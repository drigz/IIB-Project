\section{Introduction} Balancing a unicycle is a very challenging task for a
human rider. Many attempts have been made to achieve this task, using a
variety of models for the action of the rider. Some represent the rider as a
flywheel or pendulum in the coronal plane, allowing direct compensation of
falling to the side\cite{ref:zenkov,ref:murata}, as in
Figure~\ref{fig:murata}. Other use a more realistic (and challenging) model of
a flywheel in the horizontal plane\cite{ref:vos,ref:naveh}, as in
Figures~\ref{fig:naveh_unicycle}, but none of these
have reliably balanced a real unicycle.

In 2004/2005 Mellors and Lamb \cite{ref:mellors,ref:lamb} built a robotic
unicycle, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:3d_unicycle}, intending to design a controller to balance it. However, they were
only able to complete the construction of the unicycle. In 2007/2008,
D'Souza-Mathew resumed work, replacing a wheel sensor and attempting to design
a controller. He simplified the problem by removing the ability to fall to the
side, reducing it to 2D dynamic control: the inverted pendulum (from
now on referred to as the 2D system). This is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:forster_unicycle}. He was unable to balance the unicycle due to
hardware problems.

Next, in 2008/2009 Forster analysed the dynamics of both the 2D problem and
the unrestricted 3D unicycle\cite{ref:forster}. Again, hardware problems
prevented him from balancing the 2D system, and although he designed a
controller for the 3D unicycle, it was not even tested in simulation. Given
the simplicity of his approach compared to those of Vos and Naveh
\cite{ref:vos,ref:naveh}, it appears unlikely to work.

One thing all these approaches have in common is that their first step is a
series of simplifying assumptions about the dynamic system. They ignore the
non-linearities like motor dead-zones and wheel friction that are present in
any real-world system, and attempt to design a controller to stabilise the
idealised system. In many cases, this approach is very successful. However,
D'Souza-Mathew and Forster found that their model was invalid since the
unicycle's motor drive didn't react faster enough. Vos and Naveh had to use
complex, approximate techniques to model the unicycle.

An alternative ``intelligent'' approach to control involves learning the
dynamics of the system directly, instead of relying on assumptions and
mechanical analysis. Various methods for this have been used, but many require
prohibitively large amounts of data from the system. One method due to
Rasmussen and Deisenroth, known here as Reinforced Model Learnt Control
(RMLC), achieves unprecedented data efficiency, and has been successfully used
to stabilise a computer simulation of a 3D
unicycle\cite{ref:rasdei08,ref:rasdei11}.

In 2009/2010, McHutchon successfully applied RMLC to the 2D system
\cite{ref:mchutchon}. However, since he had to make significant changes to the
unicycle hardware and software to achieve this, he did not have time to
attempt to balance the 3D unicycle.

The principle objective of this project is to apply RMLC to the unrestricted
3D unicycle. This includes the solution of problems identified by McHutchon,
as well as other problems identified during the project.
